        The AudioLux project aims to address the challenge of inclusivity 
        for the deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) communities in public events 
        by enhancing accessibility in performances such as concerts.

    <p class="section_body">
        The 
        Audiolux is targeted for public event coordinators, but the device 
        is easy to manufacture and the Nanolux firmware is open source.

        By creating innovative 
        solutions to identifying traits of music such as vowel detection, 
        pitch or frequency detection, drum detection, and many more, Audiolux 
        seeks to create a more inclusive environment where audio-visual 
        experiences are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their 
        hearing abilities.
